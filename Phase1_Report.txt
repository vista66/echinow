Phase 1 Report:
- New modules:
  - Include\Core\MTFAnalyzer.mqh
  - Include\Core\ScoreCalculator.mqh
  - Include\Core\RiskManager.mqh
  - Include\Core\TradeExecutor.mqh
  - Include\Utils\Helpers.mqh
- Main file updated:
  - XAUUSD_EA.mq5 now includes phase 1 modules and phase 1 inputs.
  - OnTick executes MTF update, weighted scoring, risk-based lot sizing, and order execution.

Placement Guide:
1. Copy folder XAUUSD_EA into: <MT5 Data Folder>\MQL5\Experts\
2. Ensure all include files keep the same subfolder structure.
3. Attach XAUUSD_EA.mq5 to XAUUSD chart in MT5 Strategy Tester.

Testing Notes:
- Verify Timeframes and Weights lists have same item count.
- Check Experts tab for score logs and trade decision reasons.
- If AutoTrading is false, EA will log and skip entries.


Mismatch Handling Fix:
- Score calculator now tolerates different counts between Timeframes and Weights.
- If weights are fewer than timeframes, last valid weight is reused (fallback).
- Empty items in semicolon lists are ignored by helper parser to avoid false mismatches.
