Phase 3 Report:
- New modules:
  - Include\Patterns\PatternDetector.mqh
  - Include\Patterns\ChartPatternDetector.mqh
- Updated modules:
  - Include\Core\ScoreCalculator.mqh (pattern & chart-pattern score channels)
  - XAUUSD_EA.mq5 (phase 3 includes, inputs, pattern flow)

What was added:
1. Price Action Pattern detection (Engulfing, PinBar, Doji, Tweezer)
   - Score is applied only when pattern is close enough to nearest level.
2. Chart Pattern detection (Triangle, Channel, Rectangle)
   - Score is applied on simple breakout heuristics.
3. Score engine now re-evaluates trade direction after each extra score layer.

Placement Guide:
1. Copy the whole XAUUSD_EA folder into: <MT5 Data Folder>\MQL5\Experts\
2. Keep folder structure exactly as provided.
3. Compile XAUUSD_EA.mq5 in MetaEditor.

Testing Notes:
- Toggle each pattern input ON/OFF and verify logs change.
- Confirm near-level filtering by changing MaxPatternDistanceFromLevel.
- Check Experts log for PA/CP pattern names in score/open messages.

Hotfix Notes (pattern visibility & level clutter):
- Level drawing now limits visible S/R lines to nearest MaxLevelsToDraw items (with min touches filter).
- Old S/R objects are removed before redraw to prevent line accumulation on chart.
- Price-action detection now scans recent bars (PatternScanBars) instead of only 1 bar.
- Pattern proximity uses nearest levels with touch>=1 for detection sensitivity.
- Chart pattern breakout logic excludes the breakout candle from range calculation and shows a chart label status.
